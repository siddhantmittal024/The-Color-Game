# The-Color-Game
It's an interesting game in which RGB color code is displayed randomly along with some options from which we need to choose the correct one.<br>
Simple and attractive UI and is fully responsive design. <br>
Used javascript and mainly the JavaScript DOM for the functionality of choosing the random colors and then further working! <br>
